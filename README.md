# React Form Validation

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of form validation in React using `React Hook Form` for managing form state and `Yup` for schema-based validation.

## Features

- **Form Validation:** Utilizes `React Hook Form` for form handling and validation.
- **Schema-based Validation:** Implements validation rules with `Yup` schema validation.
- **Error Handling:** Displays clear error messages for invalid form fields.
- **Clean UI:** Simple and intuitive user interface for form interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hook Form:** Library for efficient form validation and management using React hooks.
- **Yup:** JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
- **Vite:** Fast and lightweight build tool for modern web development.
